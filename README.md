# Introduction
This project shows you a display of Audi vehicles. It is a colourful and user friendly application which allows users to browse through the web page and click on a car which will lead to a the original Audi dealership in Manchester. In this web page users can subscribe by going to the subscription page. There is also a valid contact page. Only the user input which is typed and added in the subscription is saved properly in the database and they user may delete it is they wish to.

## Homepage
The homepage consists of a beautiful layout and colour combination. The navigation menu has a background image. Within the homepage in the body, we have a single image. Under the image we have a table with three sample cars. On click, it will lead you to their official site.

## Used Cars
This page consists of a table format with six cars displaying. As a background we are using a stone image to make the images stand out. But before that we have a landing image which goes perfectly with the navigation bar.
